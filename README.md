# City Weather Dashboard with Streamlit

A real-time, interactive weather dashboard built using **Python** and **Streamlit**. This app allows users to enter a city name and get real-time weather updates, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed, for the next 12 to 48 hours. The data is pulled from the **Open-Meteo** API, with city name geolocation provided by **Nominatim (OpenStreetMap)**.
